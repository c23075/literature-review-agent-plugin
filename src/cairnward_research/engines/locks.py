"""Hash-locked requirements for the optional engines (Docling).

A lock shipped in the repository (`locks/<engine>.txt` for every platform, or
`locks/<engine>-<platform>.txt`) is installed as is, with hashes required: nothing is
resolved on the user's machine. Without one, the installer resolves the pinned
version once and records what it got (trust on first use); `cairnward-research research engine
export-lock <engine>` then copies that record into the repository so it can be reviewed
and committed.
